                        <p>
                            This small business website for microgreens was my first professional project built from
                            scratch. The website showcases my ability to build a project from the ground up, using
                            React, to create a single-page application with plenty of content. Using JavaScript, I
                            created data tables and functions to be accessed throughout the site, and each of the
                            route elements adhere to the responsive CSS I designed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although I was provided with all the images used, I was given the freedom to make all of the
                            decisions for the design and structure. I chose the colors, layout, and designed their logo.
                            I also wrote all of
                            the content for the business owner on every page. Both
                            I and the business owner are very excited about how it turned out!

                        <p>
                            This project is a recreation of Reddit, using Reddit's JSON API, for simple viewing of posts
                            and comments from popular categories. I built this application using a course project as the
                            foundation. Admittedly, this project was easily the most difficult build I have accomplished
                            so far, but
                            I also found it to be the most rewarding.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The project started as a way to enhance my skills with JavaScript, but I came to see it's
                            value as a potfolio piece very quickly. Throughout all my troubleshooting, I learned a great
                            deal more about APIs than I had in all of my courses, and I even
                            picked up a few CSS tricks along the way!

                            This final project is another API application, based on Spotify's music library, that I
                            built during my Front-End Development course. The function of this application is to allow
                            you to create playlists on your Spotify account by searching song titles, albums, or
                            artists. After the list populates, you can add or remove any item to a 'New Playlist' with a
                            title of your choice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After fulfilling all of the parameters for the project in the course, I added a full design
                            and made it my own, inspired by a playlist of my own that I had dubbed Altannertive.
                            Although the application is quite simple, It was a very enjoyable start to my career.

                    Having spent my life entranced with technology and computers, In the last few years I picked up the
                    skills to not only build my own computer, but to program it as well!
                    With multiple courses under my belt, and several projects completed, I am confident in my ability as
                    a
                    front-end web developer. Within my portfolio, I hope you will find that I'm demonstrating key skills
                    with JavaScript, HTML, CSS and React. Along with what I have learned in the field of development, I
                    am
                    confident
                    in my creativity and talent for creating unique aesthetics and designs within my projects.

                    Outside of my eagerness to start a career in tech, my hobbies include riding motorcycles, camping,
                    gaming and reading. I love music and I even play a little bass guitar. I've been fortunate enough to
                    surround myself with friends and family, and I'd be thrilled to work with and get to know you as
                    well
