  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p class="about">Having spent my life entranced with technology and computers, I recently picked up the skills to not only build my own computer, but to program it as well! 
   With multiple courses under my belt, and several projects completed, I am confident in my ability as a full-stack web developer. Below you will find my portfolio
   that includes a few of my exemplary projects, demonstrating my skills with both static and fluid site building. Along with my knowledge of code, I am confident 
  in my creativity and talent for creating unique aesthetics within my projects.</p>
